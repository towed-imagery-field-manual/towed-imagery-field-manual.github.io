To start we have to set up R for generating designs. This should not be onerous in this case. The most difficult thing is in setting up the data file in the first instance (usually through a GIS). Here we have used an asc file as this is relatively easy to read into R. This file is included in the field manual package, along with the R code to create the output below.

 

This document was created using the R-package *knitr* (Xie, 2014). It is a wonderful tool, but like any tool it requires interpretation. Most notable here is that the R-code is placed in a grey box, to enable readers to highlight the code versus the document text. Within the code sections, anything that comes after a ‘#’ symbol is a comment that is not interpreted by R (most of these are a brown colour). Bold dark blue words are function names. Dark blue words are argument names. Green is for text and light blue for numbers.

## Generate a spatially balanced design

Generating a spatially balanced design within the reserve is quite straight-forward using *MBHdesign*. Here we do it for 30 sampling sites spread throughout the reserve (Figure 2.1). Note that designs will vary from one realisation to the next, unless the seed it fixed (like we did in the previous subsection). Try it a few times, if you like, and see what happens between the realisations. Note that *on average* (over all realisations) the spatially balanced designs will have good spatial coverage.

Figure 2.2: A uniform inclusion probability sample for Governor Island

## Preference shallow environments

The equal inclusion probability design (Figure 2.2) assumes that all sites are equally advantageous to sample. Previously, we mentioned that this may not be an efficient approach to sampling. In particular, it can be advantageous to over-sample sites/regions that have greater variability. In the Governor Island reserve, this corresponds to the shallower depths as these typically are more heterogeneous and biodiverse on the east coast of Tasmania. We can design a survey with this in mind by increasing the probability that shallow sites will be sampled (i.e. by increasing their inclusion probabilities). This has the obvious effect of also decreasing the probability that deeper sites will be sampled (Figure 2.3). The code below shows how this can be done. It is a little more involved, but most of the complexity comes from detail. The approach is simple though: 1) find the empirical distribution of depths in the reserve; 2) define the inclusion probabilities based on this empirical distribution; and 3) sample according to those inclusion probabilities. We will sample a few more sites (n = 100), just to make the effect of the depth adjustment clear.

## Incorporate legacy sites

Here, for edification purposes, we provide an illustration of how to design a spatially-balanced survey that accounts for the locations of legacy sites, which are those sites that we wish to include in the survey. The most likely reason for including legacy sites is that they have been sampled before as part of a previous randomisation process. Various names exist for legacy sites, including ‘reference sites’, and perhaps even ‘sentinel sites’ in some situations.

 

In our example, we first generate legacy sites and then generate more sites around them. To provide a little extra spice to the design we try to mimic the learning process: the n = 6 legacy sites are chosen with uniform probabilities (as we would do when there is no information about the area) and then the n = 15 new sites are chosen with a depth gradient altering the inclusion probabilities (Figure 2.4). This example therefore incorporates elements of the previous two examples.

## Case study summary

We have now seen how to generate three different kinds of designs: 1) a spatially balanced design with equal inclusion probabilities for when little is known about the sources of variation of the system; 2) a spatially balanced design with unequal inclusion probabilities for when we think we know where the locations with higher variance are likely to be; and 3) a spatially balanced design for when we have legacy sites that we want to take a repeat sample.

 

If future researchers wish to re-survey the area at some point in the future, then they have a choice to make: (i) Do they wish to revisit the same sites (to get a good temporal estimate)? (ii) Do they choose a new set of sites (to get a good spatial estimate)? Or (iii) Do they assume that the temporal change is not important and include the previous survey as part of the sample? This last scenario would be performed efficiently by using the original sample locations as legacy sites and spatially balance the new sample locations around those (as was done in the example). It will usually be sensible to combine these objectives by repeating some (not all) of the samples but choosing some new locations as well.
