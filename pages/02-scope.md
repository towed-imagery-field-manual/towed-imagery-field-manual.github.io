As still and video cameras can be mounted to tow bodies in a variety of ways (Figure 7.1, Table 7.1), this field manual does not mandate specific gear types. Rather, it provides recommendations for future updates or replacement of existing platforms. It targets the suite of towed camera platforms currently being used to acquire quantitative imagery of benthic habitats in Australian waters, and seeks to standardise monitoring efforts by recommending standard operating procedures (SOPs) for survey planning, field acquisition and post-survey data processing, description, and storage for public accessibility (Figure 7.2). 

The primary aim of this field manual is to establish a consistent approach to marine benthic sampling using towed camera systems that will facilitate statistically sound compilation between studies. Note that hybrid towed systems and other video-based monitoring platforms (e.g. dropped video cameras, or video and still cameras mounted on sleds or trawls) that are commonly used to gather qualitative sample data (e.g. general animal behaviour) fall outside the scope of this manual.
